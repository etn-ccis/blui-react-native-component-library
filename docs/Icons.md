# Using Icons in Brightlayer UI React Native Components

There are two ways you can include icons in your application. The first is passing an [icon as a prop](#icon-as-a-prop) to the component and the other way is using[ `Icon` component](#icon-as-a-component) from `@brightlayer-ui/react-native-components` package as a child to the component.

## Icon as a prop

> For icon usage before v6.0.0, [check here](https://github.com/etn-ccis/blui-react-native-component-library/blob/master/docs/IconWrapper.md).

Many Brightlayer UI components support the use of icons. These components will support passing in an icon in a variety of different formats.

### Icon Object

The simplest way to use a icon in a component is to specify the icon as a simple object.

```tsx
<Component icon={{family: 'brightlayer-ui', name: 'device'}} />
<Component icon={{family: 'material-community', name: 'chart-pie'}} />
<Component icon={{name: 'settings'}} />
```

#### API

<div style="overflow: auto">

| Prop Name        | Description                                                  | Type                                                         | Required | Default      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------ |
| family           | Which library to draw the icon from                          | `'material'` \| `'material-community'` \| `'brightlayer-ui'` | no       | `'material'` |
| name             | The name of the icon to use                                  | `string`                                                     | yes      |              |
| allowFontScaling | Should the icon size scale with the system font size         | `boolean`                                                    | no       | `true`       |
| direction        | How the icon should respond to changes in language direction | `'ltr'` \| `'rtl'` \| `'auto'`                               | no       | `'ltr'`      |

</div>

When specifying 'brightlayer-ui' as the `family`, icons will be drawn from the [@brightlayer-ui/react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-vector-icons) package. When specifying 'material' or 'material-community, icons will be drawn from the [react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons) package.

When specifying the `direction`, 'auto' means that the icon will appear flipped for RTL and unflipped for LTR languages. 'ltr' will always appear unflipped, and 'rtl' will always appear flipped, regardless of language direction. Refer to our [internationalization](<https://brightlayer-ui.github.io/patterns/internationalization#bidirectionality--right-to-left-(rtl)-support>) guidelines for more information on which icons should flip.

### Inline Functional Component

You can also use an inline functional component to render other components. This can be especially useful if you want to render something other than a Material, Material Community, or Brightlayer UI icon, such as a progress icon. The functional component should support props for:

```tsx
import { PixelRatio } from 'react-native';
import { Battery } from '@brightlayer-ui/react-native-progress-icons';

// A component that doesn't need to scale with font or flip directions
<Component icon={
    ({size, color}) => (
        <Battery percent={50} size={size} color={color} />
    )}
/>
// A component that DOES need to scale with font and flip directions
<Component icon={
    ({size, color, allowFontScaling, direction}) => (
        <FlippableIcon
            size={size * (allowFontScaling ? PixelRatio.getFontScale() : 1)}
            color={color}
            style={direction === 'rtl' ? {transform: [{ scaleX: -1 }]} : {}}
        />
    )}
/>
```

#### API

<div style="overflow: auto">

| Prop Name        | Description                                                                     | Type                          | Required | Default |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------- | ------- |
| size             | What size the icon / component should be                                        | `number`                      | no       |         |
| color            | What color the icon / component should be                                       | `string`                      | no       |         |
| allowFontScaling | Should the icon / component size scale with the system font size                | `boolean`                     | no       |         |
| direction        | The current device language direction (for flipping components where necessary) | `'ltr'` \| `'rtl'`            | no       |         |
| theme            | Theme value overrides                                                           | `$DeepPartial<ExtendedTheme>` | no       |         |

</div>

Brightlayer UI components will pass these values to you for use in your component to achieve the correct appearance. It is your responsibility to apply them.

### JSX Element

You can also pass a JSX Element directly to the icon for a component. This is a very convenient way to pass icons, but you must be very careful with the size and color of elements passed in this way. Because you are not receiving props from the Brightlayer UI component (as you do with the inline functional component), you are fully responsible for making sure that icons match the specs outlined in the documentation.

```tsx
<ComponentName icon={<SomeOtherComponent size={correctSizeForComponent} color={correctColorForComponent} />} />
```

### String

In some rare cases, you may wish to pass a simple string (e.g., a single letter or number) as the icon for a component. In this case, you may pass a string directly to the icon prop. This can also be used to render emoji icons.

```tsx
<ComponentName icon={'A'} />
<ComponentName icon={'🍇'} />
```

### Image Source

The icon prop will also support images in various formats, either from local resources or from the web.

```tsx
<Component icon={{ uri: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/etn-ccis/blui-icons/dev/packages/png/png48/account_settings_black500_48dp.png' }} />
<Component icon={require('./path/to/image.png')} />
```

## Icon as a component

`<Icon>` component is an internal utility component used to render icons inside other components. It standardizes the implementation of the icon and handles all of the different ways to specify the icon without having to duplicate this logic inside every component that utilizes icons.

<img width="100%" style="max-width: 100px; display: block;" alt="Icon" src="./images/icon.png">

### Usage

```tsx
import { Icon } from '@brightlayer-ui/react-native-components';

<Icon source={{ family: 'brightlayer-ui', name: 'device' }} />;
```
