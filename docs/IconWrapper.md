# Icon Wrapper

> The IconWrapper utility is being replaced by more user-friendly icon usage alternatives. If you are still using the iconWrapper, you should start to migrate to one of the other options outlined in the [Icon](./Icons.md) guide.

The Icon Wrapper is a utility that allows the Brightlayer UI components to interact nicely with SVG icons from [`react-native-vector-icons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons) and [`@brightlayer-ui/icons-svg`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/icons-svg). Several components in this library accept a `icon` property including the type `React.ComponentType<{ size: number, color: string }>`. This allows the icon to be parameterized while allowing the library component to control the icon's size and color.

However, the icon libraries `@brightlayer-ui/icons-svg` and `react-native-vector-icons`, do not conform to this shape. Therefore, this utility exports `wrapIcon`, a Higher Order Component that can be used to convert them.

### Usage (@brightlayer-ui/icons-svg)

```tsx
import Leaf from '@brightlayer-ui/icons-svg/leaf.svg';
const LeafIcon = wrapIcon({ IconClass: Leaf });

<ComponentName IconClass={LeafIcon}></ComponentName>;
```

### Usage (react-native-vector-icons)

Icons from `react-native-vector-icons` require a class and a name. Refer to [their documentation](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) for which icons are available in each set.

```tsx
import MaterialCommunityIcon from 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons';
const Cloud = wrapIcon({ IconClass: MaterialCommunityIcon, name: 'cloud-off-outline' });

<ComponentName IconClass={Cloud}></ComponentName>;
```

### RTL (Right-to-Left) Support

If you need to flip icons for use with RTL languages, you can include a boolean `flip` property when using the wrapIcon function:

```tsx
import MaterialCommunityIcon from 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons';
const Cloud = wrapIcon({ IconClass: MaterialCommunityIcon, name: 'cloud-off-outline', flip: `true` });
```

If you want to conditionally flip icons based on the active language, you can use the `I18nManager` from react native:

```tsx
import { I18nManager } from 'react-native';
import MaterialCommunityIcon from 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons';
const Cloud = wrapIcon({ IconClass: MaterialCommunityIcon, name: 'cloud-off-outline', flip: I18nManager.isRTL });
```

### Responsive Sizing

When using the `wrapIcon` function, icons will be automatically scaled relative to the current font size selected on the device. If you would like to opt out of this behavior and render a constant icon size irrespective of the device font size setting, you can pass an additional argument for `allowFontScaling`:

```tsx
import MaterialCommunityIcon from 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons';
const Cloud = wrapIcon({ IconClass: MaterialCommunityIcon, name: 'cloud-off-outline', allowFontScaling: `false` });
```

## Notes

As with all Higher Order Components, there is a performance hit if the function is called from another component's `render` method. It is therefore advised to always call `wrapIcon()` once per Icon type, and to do so outside of any methods.

## Alternative to IconWrapper

If you do not wish to use this Higher Order Component to wrap all of your icons individually (e.g., if you need to determine the icon to show at runtime), or you would like to use a component other than a react-native-vector-icon or Brightlayer UI SVG, you can define your own function, so long as it matches the required shape:

```tsx
<ComponentName IconClass={({size, color}) => <OtherComponent size={size} color={color}>}/>
```

This can also be useful if you want to display things like a Brightlayer UI [progress icon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-progress-icons):

```tsx
import { Battery } from '@brightlayer-ui/react-native-progress-icons';

<Hero IconClass={({size, color}) => <Battery percent={50} size={size} color={color}>}/>
```
