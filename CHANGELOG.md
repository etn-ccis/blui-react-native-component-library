These greatly simplify the theming mechanism for using our dark theme, but does require updating to version 6+ of our [@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@brightlayer-ui/react-native-themes) package.
-   `unitSpace` prop to `<ChannelValue>` to manage spacing between the value and units.

-   In `<Hero>` component, `fontSize`, `value`, `valueIcon`, `valueColor` and `units` props have been replaced by `ChannelValueProps` prop, which will allow you to specify any props on the underlying `<ChannelValue>` component.
-   In `<DrawerHeader>` component, `icon` prop has been split into `icon` and `onIconPress` to better align with icon usage in other components.
-   In `<Header>` component, `navigation` prop has been split into `icon` and `onIconPress` to better align with icon usage in other components. The `navigationIcon` style override has been renamed to `icon`. The `avatar` style override has been renamed to `component`.
-   `color` prop for `<Typography>` components now supports any valid color string. You can still use string shortcuts for theme colors for 'primary', 'accent', 'text', 'error', and 'notification'.

### Removed

-   `IconProps` prop from `<EmptyState>` component â€” use `iconSize` and `iconColor` props instead.
-   `color` prop in `<ChannelValue>`, `<EmptyState>`, and `<Hero>` components no longer supports using theme keys as string. If you would like to use a value from the theme, you must pass it in as a value: `color={theme.colors.primary}` instead of `color={'primary'}`.
